# USTB - In-vivo Carotid (Verasonics L7-4)

![Focused B-mode of a carotid cross-section](assets/hero.png)

*First frame of [`L7_FI_carotid_cross_1.hdf5`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/blob/main/oslo/B_carotid/L7_FI_carotid_cross_1.hdf5), reconstructed from the raw channel data with `reconstruct.py`.*

## Dataset Description

Part of the **UltraSound ToolBox (USTB) Channel Capture Collection** (see the [collection card](../README.md)).

In-vivo human carotid-artery channel-capture data acquired with a Verasonics Vantage 256 and an L7-4 linear-array probe, cross-sectional views, focused transmit imaging. Pre-beamformed RF channel data for vascular imaging and beamforming research.

## Dataset Creation Date

06/23/2026 (packaging date; original acquisitions/simulations were produced between 2016 and 2023).

## License / Terms of Use

[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.en). Retain attribution and identify modifications when reusing the data.

## Intended Usage

Generalized reconstruction and adaptive beamforming of vascular ultrasound (RFP task 6.1). (OpenH-RF RFP task 6.1 Generalized Reconstruction).

## Dataset Characterization

- **Data Collection Method:** clinical
- **Labeling Method:** N/A (raw channel data; no annotations).
- **Acquisition system:** probe(s) L7-4; element positions stored in `/probe/probe_geometry` (meters); center frequency, sampling frequency and sound speed stored per acquisition in `/scan` (see per-sample feature table).

## Processing the Dataset

The example acquisition can be processed with the `pipeline.yaml` definition in this folder and the [zea library](https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea).

`zea` streams the data from the Hugging Face Hub and processes it according to the pipeline. You can try it out with the following command:

```bash
zea process \
  --dataset hf://nvidia/OpenH-RF/oslo/B_carotid/L7_FI_carotid_cross_1.hdf5 \
  --config hf://nvidia/OpenH-RF/oslo/B_carotid/pipeline.yaml
```

This `pipeline.yaml` holds the pipeline and display window of that acquisition. Alternatively, all acquisitions can be processed with the `reconstruct.py` [script](https://github.com/open-h/OpenH-RF/blob/main/datasets/oslo/reconstruct.py) at the root of this collection, as provided in the [OpenH-RF GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-h/OpenH-RF), together with the `pipeline*.yaml` definitions at the collection root and the [zea library](https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea). The script streams the data from the Hugging Face Hub; `parameters.yaml` picks the pipeline, display window and dynamic range per acquisition (see the [collection card](../README.md#processing-the-dataset)).

## Dataset Format

[zea v0.1.6](https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea)

All acquisitions are stored in the **zea** HDF5 file format. Each `.hdf5` file is a single acquisition with raw channel data `/data/raw_data` of shape `(n_frames, n_tx, n_ax, n_el, n_ch)` and a fully populated `/scan` group describing the transmit sequence (delays, focus distances, steering angles, apodization, timing). Data type: RF (n_ch=1). No demodulation or decimation was applied during packaging beyond conversion from the USTB Ultrasound File Format (UFF) to zea; RF data is demodulated inside the reconstruction pipeline.

## Dataset Quantification

**Current OpenH-RF release:** 3 HDF5 files; 219.48 MB (219,480,064 bytes) stored; root `zea_version` **0.1.6**. Sizes include all HDF5 contents and use decimal units (MB = 10^6 bytes, GB = 10^9 bytes, TB = 10^12 bytes), not decoded-array memory or original-source download sizes.

- **Number of acquisitions:** 3
- **Total channel-capture frames:** 6
- **Train / validation / test split:** not predefined (research dataset).
- **Stored HDF5 size:** 219.48 MB (219,480,064 bytes).

## Subject Metadata

Healthy adult volunteer(s). Anatomy: carotid artery (cross-section). Scanner: Verasonics Vantage 256. Probe: L7-4 linear array (128 elements). Aggregate only; no per-subject identifiers.

## Data Validation

A Delay-And-Sum `zea.Pipeline` (`cast -> demodulate -> delay-and-sum beamform -> envelope detect -> normalize -> log compress`; RF is demodulated in-pipeline, IQ uses a baseband pipeline) reconstructs every acquisition as a portable check that the recorded geometry and timing are correct (see *Processing the Dataset*).

The reference B-mode images committed alongside the data (`<name>_bmode.png`) are produced with the UltraSound ToolBox (USTB) MATLAB Delay-And-Sum beamformer — the exact per-dataset reconstruction used in the public USTB dataset catalog (https://unioslo.github.io/USTB/datasets.html), with scanline transmit apodization for focused/sector acquisitions and correct sector-scan geometry. These are the recommended reference reconstructions for visual verification.

## Known Issues

Single/few-frame acquisitions; focused linear imaging.

## Ethical Considerations

In-vivo data recorded from healthy adult volunteers at the University of Oslo with written informed consent for research use and data sharing, and approval from the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK), Norway. Files contain only RF channel data and acquisition parameters; no HHS Safe Harbor identifiers are present.
