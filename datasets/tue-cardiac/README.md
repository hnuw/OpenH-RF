*Parasternal long-axis cine loops of four volunteers, pulse-inversion harmonic tracks: focused ([`subject-002`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/blob/main/tue-cardiac/data/subject-002.hdf5)), wide ([`subject-004`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/blob/main/tue-cardiac/data/subject-004.hdf5)), focused ([`subject-006`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/blob/main/tue-cardiac/data/subject-006.hdf5)) and wide ([`subject-009`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/blob/main/tue-cardiac/data/subject-009.hdf5)).*

## Dataset Description

This dataset contains pre-beamformed radio-frequency (RF) channel data from in-vivo human cardiac ultrasound acquisitions of 12 distinct adult healthy volunteers, aged 26–33 years. The operator attempted a parasternal long-axis (PLAX) view for every participant. Each participant file contains eight separately acquired 100-frame tracks (3s,33Hz) that vary the transmit encoding: focused fundamental, focused pulse-inversion harmonic, wide fundamental, wide pulse-inversion harmonic, plane wave, diverging wave, Hadamard-coded aperture, and random binary-coded aperture.

The data were acquired on a Verasonics Vantage 256 research platform with a Philips S5-1 phased-array probe. The contribution is intended to support generalized reconstruction, transmit-encoding research, REFoCUS recovery, compressed sensing, and comparisons of fundamental and second-harmonic imaging.

## Intended Usage

Intended research uses include:

- raw-channel-to-B-mode reconstruction and beamforming;
- REFoCUS recovery of synthetic-transmit-aperture data;
- sparse or compressed transmit-sequence reconstruction;
- comparison of focused, wide, plane-wave, diverging, and coded transmissions;
- comparison of fundamental and pulse-inversion harmonic acquisitions; and
- development and evaluation of ultrasound inverse-problem methods.

The dataset must not be used as a clinically validated diagnostic product.

## Dataset Characterization

- **Data collection method:** in-vivo human cardiac ultrasound on a research platform.
- **Anatomy and view:** heart; attempted parasternal long-axis (PLAX) view.
- **Cohort:** 12 adult healthy volunteers, aged 26–33 years, recruited from among researcher colleagues. No known pathologies were reported.
- **Acquisition protocol:** the eight modes were acquired sequentially in the fixed order shown below. The probe was kept as steady as possible. Before each recording, the volunteer was instructed to breathe out.
- **Operator:** No ultrasound training or prior experience.
- **Acquisition system:** Verasonics Vantage 256 with a Philips S5-1 phased-array probe.
- **Probe:** phased-array, 80 active elements, nominal probe center frequency 3.125 MHz, and 128% fractional bandwidth.
- **Receive sampling:** 15.625 MHz; 2,304 axial samples; raw `int16` RF with one real channel. For pulse inversion imaging, the two acquisitions are summed in buffer.
- **Nominal sound speed:** 1,540 m/s.
- **Frame rate:** approximately 33 frames/s for each track.
- **Coordinate convention:** x = lateral, y = elevation, z = axial/depth.

| Order | Track label | Transmit family | Stored transmits/frame | Transmit center frequency | Notes |
|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| 01 | `focused_fund` | Focused, ±45° | 80 | 3.90625 MHz | 60 mm transmit focus |
| 02 | `focused_harm` | Focused, ±45° | 80 | 1.953125 MHz | 160 receive events are pulse-inversion accumulated to 80 stored transmits; 3.90625 MHz demodulation |
| 03 | `wide_fund` | Wide focused, ±45° | 80 | 3.90625 MHz | 150 mm transmit focus |
| 04 | `wide_harm` | Wide focused, ±45° | 80 | 1.953125 MHz | 160 receive events are pulse-inversion accumulated to 80 stored transmits; 3.90625 MHz demodulation |
| 05 | `planewave` | Steered plane wave, ±45° | 80 | 3.90625 MHz | Infinite transmit focus |
| 06 | `diverging` | Diverging wave, ±45° | 80 | 3.90625 MHz | Negative virtual-focus distance varies with steering angle |
| 07 | `hadamard` | Full-aperture Hadamard code | 80 | 3.90625 MHz | Zero transmit delays and ±1 apodization; REFoCUS decoding required |
| 08 | `random` | Full-aperture fixed random binary code | 80 | 3.90625 MHz | Zero transmit delays and ±1 apodization; REFoCUS decoding required |

## Processing the Dataset

The acquisitions can be processed with the `reconstruct.py` [script](https://github.com/open-h/OpenH-RF/blob/main/datasets/tue-cardiac/reconstruct.py) as provided in the [OpenH-RF GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-h/OpenH-RF), together with the `pipelines/*.yaml` definitions in this folder and the [zea library](https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea). The script streams the data from the Hugging Face Hub.

Each file holds the eight transmit-encoding tracks. Set `ZEA_FILE`, `TRACK` and `FRAME` at the top of the script, together with the matching pipeline under `pipelines/` as `CONFIG` (`PIPELINE_FOR_TRACK` lists which track uses which; see also [Data Validation](#data-validation)). The image is written to `assets/`.

## Dataset Format

[zea v0.1.4](https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea)

The final dataset contains 12 zea HDF5 files under `data/`, one per pseudonymized participant:

```text
data/
  subject-001.hdf5
  ...
  subject-012.hdf5
```

Each file has one shared `/probe` group, one de-identified `/metadata` group, and eight entries under `/tracks`. Track labels identify the transmit encoding. Raw channel data for each track are stored at:

The source tensor order is preserved as `(n_frames, n_tx, n_ax, n_el, n_ch) = (100, 80, 2304, 80, 1)` with dtype `int16`. Values are uncalibrated Verasonics receive samples.

## Data Validation

Four saved zea pipeline configurations are provided under `pipelines/`:

| Pipeline | Tracks | Difference from general pipeline |
|---|---|---|
| `pipeline.yaml` | `focused_fund`, `wide_fund`, `planewave`, `diverging` | General RF-to-B-mode pipeline |
| `pipeline_harmonic.yaml` | `focused_harm`, `wide_harm` | Denser output grid for second-harmonic receive frequency |
| `pipeline_hadamard.yaml` | `hadamard` | Adjoint REFoCUS decoding before beamforming |
| `pipeline_random.yaml` | `random` | Tikhonov-regularized REFoCUS decoding before beamforming |

All configurations perform RF filtering, demodulation, delay-and-sum beamforming, envelope detection, normalization, log compression, and scan conversion.

## Known Issues

- A good PLAX view is not always available for all recordings.
- Some transmit types, like random apodization recordings, do not give a good quality B-mode. They are not intended to have the best quality, but for comparison.
- The two harmonic tracks are pulse-inversion-accumulated nonlinear measurements and should not be treated as linear equivalents of the fundamental tracks.
- Accumulated harmonic data may lack per-transmit timing arrays; the measured frame rate is documented instead.
- Hadamard and random tracks require REFoCUS decoding before conventional beamforming.
- A Verasonics scalar lens-delay correction is retained under `/custom` for provenance, but it is not equivalent to zea's refractive lens model.
